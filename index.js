/*
Here's a list of features that our code needs to support:

Allow multiple accounts to be created
Each account can have many transactions
Allow withdrawals and deposits into accounts
Allow us to retrieve the transaction history of an account (all withdrawals and deposits)
Allow us to retrieve the current balance of the account at any time
Don't allow withdrawals that exceed the remaining balance of the account
*/
let balance = 500.00;

class Withdrawal {

  constructor(amount) {
    this.amount = amount;
  }

  commit() {
    balance -= this.amount;
  }

}




// DRIVER CODE BELOW
// We use the code below to "drive" the application logic above and make sure it's working as expected

t1 = new Withdrawal(50.25);
t1.commit();
console.log('Transaction 1:', t1);

t2 = new Withdrawal(9.99);
t2.commit();
console.log('Transaction 2:', t2);

console.log('Balance:', balance);
